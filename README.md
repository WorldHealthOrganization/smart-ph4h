# WHO SMART GUIDELINES - PH4H

The Pan-American Digital Health Route (PH4H) is an initiative that aims to enable connected health for
all people in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Led by the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB](https://www.iadb.org/en),
the Pan-American Health Organization [PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en) and the countries of the region, this initiative aims to
facilitate the exchange of health data in a secure, efficient and interoperable manner, both within and
between countries, allowing people in the region to share and access their health information. PH4H
promotes regional synergy by maximizing national investments for the exchange of health information.
In addition, it maintains continuous coordination with regional organizations and networks in digital
health, thus strengthening integration and efficiency in the sector.

The objective of PH4H is for patients to obtain better health services regardless of their location. In this
way, it will improve the health care of those who temporarily move for work or study reasons. For
migrants, it will enable them to share their medical history, which will improve their employment and
education opportunities. In addition, the digital route will strengthen public health surveillance,
optimize access to limited human resources, and foster research and innovation, resulting in more
efficient public health policies and improved regional economies. As a result, countries will be better
prepared for future pandemics and other health threats. Cross-border use cases that can be
implemented within PH4H can be seen at this link.

Unlike a physical route, a digital route transcends borders, allowing universal access without leaving
anyone behind. The initiative, which will be officially launched at the end of 2024, is supported by the
Enhanced Initiative for Quality Infrastructure, Disaster Resilience and Health Fund, funded by the
Government of Japan. We look forward to more partners joining us on this transformative journey.
