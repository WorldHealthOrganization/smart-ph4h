## PH4H Trust Domain Policy

### Participation and Governance

* Participation by each country and use of the PH4H trust domain is completely voluntary and free of charge.
* The PH4H initiative falls under the policies approved by countries during the PAHO Ministers of Health Session, which are outlined in the **Plan of Action for Strengthening Information Systems for Health 2024-2030** ([https://www.paho.org/en/documents/ce17415-plan-action-strengthening-information-systems-health-2024-2030](https://www.paho.org/en/documents/ce17415-plan-action-strengthening-information-systems-health-2024-2030)).
* This plan of action fully aligns with recommendations made by Member States of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) at the Regional Event on Digital Transformation in the Health Sector held in Panama City in November 2022. It also reflects the recent consultation with PAHO Member States at RELACSIS 4.0: Information Systems & Digital Health in the Americas, a regional meeting held in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2023. The plan responds to PAHO's call to action for the digital transformation of the health sector in the Region, including the implementation of the Pan-American Highway for Digital Health, an initiative led by PAHO and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
* the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en/project/RG-T4546">IDB Regional Technical Cooperation RG-T4546</a>, supported by the Government of Japan, will support critical work required to operate the PH4H, including frameworks for policy and governance 

### Responsibilities and Limitations

* The PH4H initiative, PAHO, and the IDB are not responsible for the content of the documents produced by each country.
* Verification of documents with electronic seals through the PAHO/WHO trust network enhances trust, but the receiving country or institution must assess its validity. This verification does not constitute a binding guarantee on the part of PAHO/WHO.

### Technical Considerations

* Each country uses private keys to sign documents complying with those defined in the PH4H domain. These keys may be used to sign other documents as required by the Health authority of each country.
