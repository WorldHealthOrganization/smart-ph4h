### Overview
The PH4H initiative is working to define a comprehensive set of technical specifications for each proposed use case. These specifications aim to ensure interoperability, data quality, and user experience across different health information systems.

### Key Components of Technical Specifications
For each use case, PH4H is defining the following:

* **Indicators, evaluation, and monitoring:** Metrics for measuring the effectiveness and impact of the solution.
* **Functional and non-functional requirements:** Detailed descriptions of the system's capabilities and constraints.
* **Usage scenarios:** Examples of how the system will be used in real-world settings.
* **Processes and workflows:** Steps involved in using the system.
* **Generic personas:** Descriptions of the different types of users.
* **Minimum data elements:** Core data elements required for the system to function.
* **Process execution logic:** Rules and algorithms governing the system's behavior.

### Indicators, Evaluation, and Monitoring

PH4H has already defined an indicator related to cross-border data exchange within the **Strategic Line of Action 2: Strengthen data management and information technologies** of the <a href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/ce17415-plan-action-strengthening-information-systems-health-2024-2030">**PLAN OF ACTION FOR STRENGTHENING INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR HEALTH 2024â€“2030**</a>, as approved by the 174th Session of the Executive Committee PAHO.

| Indicator | Baseline (2023) | Target (2030) |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1.4 Number of countries and territories that have adopted cross-border data exchange agreements in the context of the Global Digital Health Certification Network and the PAHO-IDB Pan-American Highway for Digital Health | 3 | 30 |

This indicator will be used to track the progress of PH4H in facilitating cross-border data exchange and promoting interoperability among health information systems in the Americas.

### Current Use Cases and Specifications
PH4H is currently collaborating with countries on the following use cases:
